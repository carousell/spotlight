#Spotlight ðŸ”¦
**A kickass dashboard for devshops**

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/neo/spotlight.svg?token=32PipsqvKVziGaUwVvvT)](https://travis-ci.com/neo/spotlight)

## Synopsis

Spotlight is a simple dashboard for your devshop that: 

 * Allows people to easily create a dashboard and manage widgets from a predefined set of widgets. 
 * Is wrapped in a container that can easily be downloaded and installed on any environment.
 * Lets you view Continuous Integration build status for the various projects is the primary goal. 
 * Lets you add new widgets from a list of predefined ones, or create your own.


## Motivation

Software developers are increasingly adopting agile and lean approaches to the software development lifecycle. One key component for agile software processes is that of Continuous Integration (CI). With the ubiquity of inexpensive hardware like flat panel displays and Raspberry Pis (single board computer), the DIY approach to building custom information displays is gaining increasing appeal.

We belive there is a need for a simple, hassle free approach to CI monitors.
